Time for the first new monthly status update! I do like those updates from <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/06/15/Status-update.html">Drew DeVault</a>
and <a href="https://emersion.fr/blog/2020/status-update-19/">Simon Ser</a>, so I figured, why not trying myself 🙃. I am not sure where to start and
where to end, but I guess I&rsquo;ll figure things out as I go.

As you know, <i>or may not</i>, I am working on the <a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/">TektonCD</a> project and also on our <a href="https://redhat.com">RedHat</a>
product <a href="https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/pipelines">OpenShift Pipelines</a>. As far as the month of June went :
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We release <a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.13.0">v0.13.0</a> &ldquo;Bobtail Bishop&rdquo; and a bunch of fixes (<a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.13.2">v0.13.2</a>)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It&rsquo;s the second release after the <code>v1beta1</code> bump, and we start to stabilise things.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.14.0">v0.14.0</a> will (and actually is already) a more feature-packed release because there is
now the <code>finally</code> field support and cloud-events opt-in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
But the <b>most important</b> contributions I tried to make during that month is the TEP
process. <b>TEP</b> stands for <b>Tekton Enhancement proposals</b>.

<pre class="src src-markdown"># Tekton Enhancement Proposals (TEPs)

A Tekton Enhancement Proposal (TEP) is a way to propose, communicate
and coordinate on new efforts for the Tekton project.  You can read
the full details of the project in
[TEP-1](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/teps/0001-tekton-enhancement-proposal-process.md).

## What is a TEP

A standardized development process for Tekton is proposed in order to

- provide a common structure and clear checkpoints for proposing
  changes to Tekton
- ensure that the motivation for a change is clear
- allow for the enumeration stability milestones and stability
  graduation criteria
- persist project information in a Version Control System (VCS) for
  future Tekton users and contributors
- support the creation of _high value user facing_ information such
  as:
  - an overall project development roadmap
  - motivation for impactful user facing changes
- ensure community participants are successfully able to drive changes
  to completion across one or more releases while stakeholders are
  adequately represented throughout the process

This process is supported by a unit of work called a Tekton
Enhancement Proposal (TEP). A TEP attempts to combine aspects of the
following:

- feature, and effort tracking document
- a product requirements document
- design document

into one file which is created incrementally in collaboration with one
or more [Working
Groups](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/working-groups.md)
(WGs).

This process does not block authors from doing early design docs using
any means. It does not block authors from sharing those design docs
with the community (during Working groups, on Slack, GitHub, ….

**This process acts as a requirement when a design docs is ready to be
implemented or integrated in the `tektoncd` projects**. In other words,
a change that impact other `tektoncd` projects or users cannot be
merged if there is no `TEP` associated with it.

This TEP process is related to
- the generation of an architectural roadmap
- the fact that the what constitutes a feature is still undefined
- issue management
- the difference between an accepted design and a proposal
- the organization of design proposals

This proposal attempts to place these concerns within a general
framework.


See [TEP-1](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/teps/0001-tekton-enhancement-proposal-process.md) for more details.

<h2 id="%3Dhome%3D%2C%20Nixos%20and%20the%20rest%20of%20thing"><code>home</code>, Nixos and the rest of thing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-%3Dhome%3D%2C%20Nixos%20and%20the%20rest%20of%20thing">
<p>
I did some big changes in my <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdemeester/home"><code>home</code></a> repository, it&rsquo;s still much a work-in-progress but it
is in a way better state than before.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is more reproductible. All dependencies are managed by <a href="https://github.com/nmattia/niv">niv</a> and all machines are using
a pinned version of channels from there. That way I can test the configuration (on the
CI) and cache the packages for all channels that my machines uses. I also can decide
when I want to upgrade a particular channel (nixos, unstable, …).</li>
<li>I am slowly experimenting on simplifying things more and more. This is a bit related to
the <a href="2020-02-22-digital-minimalism.html">previous post</a>. I am trying to use Gnome3 everywhere. Well configured, managed by
NixOS, it&rsquo;s enough for my test and reduce the configuration cruft I need to do.</li>
</ul>

<p>
An ongoing work is my knowledge base and how it is published as part of this website :
<a href="https://vincent.demeester.fr/articles/">articles</a>. I am trying to make all those publishable (for the one that do not hold any
secret). I&rsquo;ll document this a bit more at some point but…
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Configurations are now part of that knowledge base, the <code>docs</code> folder of <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdemeester/home"><code>home</code></a> is going
away.</li>
<li>I am trying to use litterate configuration as much as possible. So slowly, the content
from <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdemeester/home"><code>home</code></a> will be a tangled version of my knowledge base. At least that is the goal as
of today.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And I feel that&rsquo;s all <i>for June</i>.
