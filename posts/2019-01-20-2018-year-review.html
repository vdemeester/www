Here is my review of 2018, the first of its kind, hopefully not the last 👼. I saw
some<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> <i>2018<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> reviews</i><sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> articles<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> in my Feedly feed and I thought it
would be a good idea to write my own too.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ll try in the next year — maybe month if I ever want to do monthly reviews — to automate
some of it ; using the beloved <code>org-mode</code>.

<p>
The big change this year is : I changed job 👼. I went from Docker Inc. to Red Hat. I
needed a change and 5 month in, I think it was the <b>best choice I made in my life</b> so far
💃. I&rsquo;m doing open-source for a living and best part, I am working remotely (more on that
later).
</p>

<p>
Before that, at Docker Inc., I continued the work I started years before,
a.k.a. maintaining the Moby project and the docker engine, among other Docker project
(both open-source and closed-source). I also helped the work on the compose side, from the
root of <code>docker/compose-on-kubernetes</code> (before it got open-sourced), to the <code>docker/app</code>
experiments.
</p>

<p>
At Red Hat, I started to work upstream in the Kubernetes community, mainly on the Knative
projects. I also work on the Openshift Cloud Function project (and thus team), and those
fellows are awesome ! Digging more into Openshift, and other part of the Red Hat portfolio
is a really good learning experience, and it&rsquo;s just the start !
</p>

<p>
As stated above, I am now working home, full-time. I could work from home from time to
time when I was at Docker inc, but working home full-time is another kind of beast. So far
it is really good, some adjustments were needed but it&rsquo;s for the best. Here is a small
take on &ldquo;working from home&rdquo;:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to have <b>no distraction</b>, thus having <b>really productive</b> piece of time</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also <b>really easy to work long day or really long period of time</b>. It&rsquo;s especially
true if, like me, you work on a distributed team (across multiple timezones).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I ended up using the Pomodoro technique to make sure I move at least few times a day</li>
<li>I try to make sure I don&rsquo;t make an habits of checking out work code, email and other
material after a certain hour in the evening. It&rsquo;s ok to do it sometimes, but for your
sanity, you need some rest time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to adapt your day to circumstance. If you got to run errands in the middle of
the day, it&rsquo;s no big deal. You can take the time back later on.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s so good to have <b>no</b> commmute time. That said I end up <i>walking or taking the bike</i>
early morning to clear my head before work 😝.</li>
</ul>

Health wise, it&rsquo;s a mix of good and bad year. The first half was really good, the second
way less. End of august, I felt something weird in the right knee, and well, turns out my
internal meniscus is in a real bad shape. Just as before joining Docker, I&rsquo;m gonna need a
surgery, on the right knee that time. It&rsquo;s gonna affect 2019 (the first half, I&rsquo;m not
gonna be able to move around much but.. meh, it&rsquo;s life).
</p>

<p>
Now that I work from home, I&rsquo;m really glad I got a standing desk at the end of 2017. I
tend to work standing most of the time &#x2013; except when my knee hurts (and most likely for
few months after the surgery 😅). I invested on a ultrawide screen, to get the same
experience I had at Docker. And oh boy those screens are good !
</p>

<p>
I also try to clean my desk and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;neighboorhood&rdquo;. As I get older, I want less messy
stuuf (desk, flat, &#x2026;). I&rsquo;m leaning towards having less stuff, being commputer related or
not. It&rsquo;s not minimalism, but it feel good to have less stuff, but stuff that you actually
use. I still have trouble throwing old computer away, mainly because I fell they can be
useful in some way.

This year I migrate all of my &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; computer to NixOS. I learned a lot of Nix,
reworked my configuration multiple time to end up with a <a href="https://github.com/vdemeester/nixos-configuration.git">system configuration repository</a>
that uses modules, and a <a href="https://github.com/vdemeester/home.git"><i>home configuration repository</i></a> (for user configuration). The
<a href="https://github.com/vdemeester/home.git">home</a> repository uses <a href="https://github.com/rycee/home-manager.git"><code>home-manager</code></a> and thus doesn&rsquo;t make any assumption of running on top
of NixOS. This allows me to have an <i>easy to get</i> setup on any system that <code>nixpkgs</code>
supports (any Linux distribution, Mac OSX, Windows Subsystem Linux). The current
configuration is not yet optimal but I&rsquo;m pretty happy about what I got :
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Custom DNS server @home to make it easier to target local hosts.</li>
<li>Local proxies and mirrors for docker images, nixpkgs binary package and go modules to
eat less bandwidth.</li>
<li>Easy to setup VPN using <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a>.</li>
<li>File replication using <code>syncthing</code> and automatic backup on my local NAS.</li>
<li>Automatic system upgrade, thanks to NixOS. I&rsquo;ll probably write an article about that
later on this year.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I started to use <code>todoist</code> in 2017, and boy, oh boy, it helped me quite a lot ! I&rsquo;m using
it daily to organize my work and quickly get idea, and <i>todos</i> out of my head. The main
problem with it is it&rsquo;s not integrated with another tool I&rsquo;m using daily : Emacs and
<code>org-mode</code>. <code>org-mode</code> is a fantastic piece of software and is, on its own, the main
reason for me to invest time in Emacs. I&rsquo;m taking note in <code>org-mode</code>, I write my daily
standup notes in there too. I end up going back and forth between <code>org-mode</code> and <code>todoist</code>
for those daily standup. I am lazy, I want to automate that. And the best way to do it, is
to also use <code>org-mode</code> for task management. I&rsquo;m in a <i>transition</i> mode right now, but my
goal for 2019 is to use todoist to take quick note/todo(s) on the move (aka on the phone)
and use <code>org-mode</code> for the rest.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Reading%20%26%20Writing">
<p>
I used to like reading, but the past years, I didn&rsquo;t really read that much, except some
technical books. 2018 in, that respect, is not an exception, I didn&rsquo;t read too much. Worse
than that, I started some book and stopped at some point, for no apparent reason ; and
now, I need to start back from the beginning, which, well, is not helping me want to read
them again.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m trying two thing to counter that and consume more books for the years to come.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I now have a reading list on my <code>org-mode</code> files, where I track which one I read and
when I read them ; and maybe notes too. I have a lot of book on my kindle, that only
wait for one thing, being read..</li>
<li>I subscribed to <a href="https://www.audible.fr">Audible</a> 👼. Working from home, I tend to take a long break after lunch,
where I&rsquo;m going for a walk, for around an hour. I can&rsquo;t read while walking but I
definitely can listen - that make audio books perfect for these moments. I also
alternate between audio books and non-musical podcasts.</li>
</ol>

<p>
On the writing side, 2017 was a slow year in terms of writing (only 2 posts), 2018 was a
bit better, 6 posts &#x2013; it&rsquo;s a bit cheating, as it was mainly between changing jobs, and
on a series I still need to finish. I&rsquo;m hoping to write more this year, hence the goals
I&rsquo;ve set to myself below.

<h2 id="2019%20Goals">2019 Goals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2019%20Goals">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Get back on my feet after knee surgery (exercices, …)</b> 🏃</li>
<li><b>Read at least one book per month (be audible, ebook or paper)</b> 📖</li>
<li><p>
<b>Giving at least a talk (on Knative, containers, nixos, ..)</b> 🙊
</p>

<p>
I didn&rsquo;t give too much talk in 2018 (at least less than 2017). I&rsquo;m gonna try to get back
at it this year. The surgery won&rsquo;t help but it&rsquo;s just few months.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>At least 1 video per month</b> 📹
</p>

<p>
I want to start recording some video, as I feel it&rsquo;s an easier medium than writing and,
well, I wanna try !
</p></li>

<li><b>At least 1 post per month</b> ✍️</li>
<li><p>
<b>Enhance my emacs skills (aka don&rsquo;t be afraid of the lisp)</b> ⌨️
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m using Emacs for almost anything that doesn&rsquo;t happen in a web browser. But I still
feel like a newbie. I want to learn more, to write more lisp that help me being even
more lazier (aka achieve more doing less 😝)
</p></li>

<li><b>Enhance my Nix(OS) skills</b> 🐧</li>
<li><p>
<b>Learn / master a new language</b> 🎽
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m working with Go 90% of my time. I want to master and learn more language. On my list
are Emacs Lisp, Rust, Typescript and Haskell.
