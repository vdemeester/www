I&rsquo;ve been reading and listening about Minimalism and Digital Minimalism for a little while
now. I&rsquo;ve watch some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ24N4O0bP7LGLBDvye7oCA">Matt D&rsquo;Avella</a> youtube video (and documentary), read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism">Digital
Minimalism</a> from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport">Cal Newport</a>, and read a bunch of <a href="#Links">articles and blog posts</a>.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn&rsquo;t say I am a minimalist, neither am I a digital minimalist <b>but</b> it is something
that is a bit appealing and I feel I am slowly taking inspiration from those. I&rsquo;ve started
reducing to a minimun what my <i>smart</i>-phone does, I&rsquo;ve reduced the number of <i>gadgets</i>
I&rsquo;ve add over time. But in this posts, I am going to focus on my systems and tools — this
means Linux distributions, Emacs and other tools.

I&rsquo;ve been using GNU/Linux for ages now. It has been around 22 years now that I discovered
Red Hat<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Linux, 5.2 at the time. I&rsquo;ve use it as my primary operating system almost
ever sync. During that time, I&rsquo;ve tried so many distribution: from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux">Mandrake</a> (later
Mandriva), to <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> (3.0 -&gt; 9.0 on some servers) and <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> (on the first ever public
release), with a long time on <a href="https://gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> and later <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Archlinux</a>. I&rsquo;ve used Gnome, KDE, wmii,
XMonad, awesome-vm. I&rsquo;ve used bash, zsh, fish, switching from one to another multiple
times. I&rsquo;ve used Emacs, vim, IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode… My gentoo/archlinux days made me
try and <i>use</i> a lot of tools (screen, tmux, …) and customization.
</p>

<p>
I had the habit to customize everything, down to the theme and icons I use. There was a
time where I would patch and re-package some GTK themes and icons set. <b>I had to
customize everything</b>, that was my learning experience. I would often break things and
have to re-install the system — and <b>it was fun</b> 😎.
</p>

<p>
But the more I <i>grew</i>, the more I worked for different companies, the less time I had to
do this. I was also learning a lot about tests, reproducibility at that time. My <i>will</i> to
customization and <i>instability</i> slowly faded, I wanted to be able to focus on what
mattered, and not loose time on silly things that I would break soon after making it.

<h2 id="Minimalism%20and%20Digital%20Mininalism">Minimalism and Digital Mininalism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Minimalism%20and%20Digital%20Mininalism">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s try to define really quick what is minimalism and digital minimalism about.Digital
minimalism is Minimalism in the digital world, and <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">minimalism</a> can be seen as <a href="https://jamesstuber.com/minimalism-as-a-framework/">a Framework
for Decision Making</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Every decision we make is constrained by limited resources. Money, materials, energy. Even
the richest man in the world is limited by time, and has to make decisions accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Here are some factors that make minimalism well suited for decision making:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Practicing minimalism helps develop an improved ability to discern what’s important and
what’s not</li>
<li>It becomes easier to let go of ‘sort of important’ things</li>
<li>What you choose to keep is a reflection of your values</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a gist, Digital Minimalism is about making conscious choice of what you use and what
you do in the digital world, a world of abundance (information, software, …).
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s take two examples: our desktops and our phones.
</p>

<p>
On desktop, digital minimalism can be something like the follow blog post : <a href="http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2014/07/anti-dashboard-manifesto.html">Tech Notes:
The Anti-Dashboard Manifesto</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Now take that reasoning further: It&rsquo;s not useful to reserve a portion of my screen for
displaying which applications are running, as the things that are running are visible and
the things that aren&rsquo;t visible can be found when necessary. There&rsquo;s no need for an icon
displaying wifi status; if I&rsquo;m connected it&rsquo;s uninteresting and if I&rsquo;m not connected I&rsquo;ll
surely discover it if I attempt to use the internet.
</p>

<p>
I took this reasoning to its conclusion. I run my computers with the screen blank except
for the apps I run, and the apps I run I configure to display a minimal amount of
information. I think of this as being anti-dashboard: against the cognitive clutter of
extraneous information. My computer is not a cockpit and I am at my best when I&rsquo;m only
thinking about the single task at hand.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is taking things a little bit too far for me <b>but</b> it does resonate with me, and as
you&rsquo;ll see in the following articles (and on my configuration), I share some of Evan&rsquo;s
belief. By default, my desktop do only show a background (be an image or a color) and
anything related to time, battery and other status is a keybinding away (the <code>Win</code> key).
</p>

<p>
And on the phone: <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2020/03/18/yourself-happier-iphone-worse/">How to make yourself happier by making your iPhone worse | Robert Heaton</a>
— which I followed almost word for word, but this isn&rsquo;t the subject of this post.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Emacs%2C%20Nix%2C%20NixOS%2C%20%3Dhome-manager%3D%20and%20other%20tools">
<p>
How a GNU/Linux distribution like NixOS comes into this. First, let&rsquo;s see what I want :
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A system that is tailored to my needs, that makes me efficient.</li>
<li>A system that is customizable, to answer the previous item. I want to be able to modify
the default behavior if it doesn&rsquo;t suit me.</li>
<li>A system that is reproductible and easy to replicate. If I change my hardware, or if I
need to re-install my system for <i>any reason</i>.</li>
<li>A way to share configuration on my infra. This is probably the developer speaking, but I
want to write something once and re-use it several times.</li>
<li>A developer environment that is reproductible, on-demand and <i>safe</i>.</li>
<li>Use defaults of the software I use as much as possible. This one is tricky to achiev for
several reasons:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I am used to customize everything (<i>easy to fix</i>)</li>
<li>I use a custom keyboard layout (<a href="https://bepo.fr">bepo</a>), so if I go with default keybinding, I will have
the wrong <i>muscle memory</i> (and they could be not optimized either)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hackable tools that I can manipulate as I want.</li>
<li>Use the right tool at the right time, trying not to reinvent the wheel.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As it turns out Nix and NixOS are giving all the components required for my <i>almost</i> ideal
setup.
</p>

<p>
If you complete that with a <i>not really minimalist</i> editor, called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>, you&rsquo;ve got a
pretty composable system without leaving Emacs. I&rsquo;ll dig more into my Emacs configuration
and my NixOS setup in different posts — and on the <a href="https://vincent.demeester.fr/configurations/"><code>configurations</code></a> pages — but my take
lately is to try to do with what is available (as built-in, in Emacs for example). After
reading the docs, if it&rsquo;s not sufficient, I may look for an external module or tool.

<p>
This was a weird post that mixes up tooling, minimalism and thoughts. It&rsquo;s definitely not
what I initially envisioned. But I&rsquo;m hoping it introduce a bit my take on things.
