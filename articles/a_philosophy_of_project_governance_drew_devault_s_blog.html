<h1 class="title">A philosophy of project governance | Drew DeVault’s Blog</h1>
</header><p>
I’ve been in the maintainer role for dozens of projects for a while now, and have
moderated my fair share of conflicts. I’ve also been on the other side, many times, as a
minor contributor watching or participating in conflict within other projects. Over the
years, I’ve developed an approach to project governance which I believe is lightweight,
effective, and inclusive.
</p>

<p>
I hold the following axioms to be true:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Computer projects are organized by humans, creating a social system.</li>
<li>Social systems are fundamentally different from computer systems.</li>
<li>Objective rules cannot be programmed into a social system.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And the following is true of individuals within those systems:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Project leadership is in a position to do anything they want.</li>
<li>Project leadership will ultimately do whatever they want, even if they have to come up
with an interpretation of the rules which justifies it.</li>
<li>Individual contributors who have a dissonant world-view from project leadership will
never be welcome under those leaders.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Any effective project governance model has to acknowledge these truths. To this end, the
simplest effective project governance model is a BDFL, which scales a lot further than
people might expect.
