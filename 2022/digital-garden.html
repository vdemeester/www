<h1 class="title">A Digital Garden you say…</h1>
<p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Let&rsquo;s try to describe what this &ldquo;website&rdquo; is about ✍️.</p>
</header><p>
As I said in <a href="random.html">&ldquo;Random thoughts after 2 years&rdquo;</a>, I&rsquo;ve been inspired by <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">Joel&rsquo;s digital garden</a>
article. This article aims to provide a bit of how I intend to maintain this space from
now on.
</p>

<p>
This space is inspired by <a href="https://www.la-grange.net/">a</a> <a href="https://larlet.fr/david/">lot</a> <a href="https://joelhooks.com/">of</a> <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/">other</a> spaces, but adapted to my vision. I think I&rsquo;ve
always struggled with the blog approach. I sometimes want to publish things that are not
related to time. That can be true no matter when you read it. The opposite is true as
well.
</p>

<p>
I really like the way Joel speaks about it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
While not everybody has or works in a dirt garden, we all share a
familiarity with the idea of what a garden is.
</p>

<p>
A garden is usually a place where things grow.
</p>

<p>
Gardens can be very personal and full of whimsy or a garden can be a
source of food and substance.
</p>

<p>
We gather and work together in community gardens to share the labor as
well as the rewards of a collective effort.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s a comparison that you can take very far. From &ldquo;planting seeds&rdquo;
and &ldquo;pulling weeds&rdquo; to tending mutiple gardens that each serve an
individual need or desired outcome.
</p>

<p>
Like with real gardens, our digital gardens are a constant ebb and
flow towards entropy.
</p>

<p>
Weeds take over. Left untended the Earth will reclaim what belongs to
it.
</p>

<p>
The same is true for our digital gardens here on the internet.
</p>

<p>
There is quite some things I still did not figure out:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I am not sure how to handle <code>rss</code> yet. It is slightly easier for a time-based approach
such as a &ldquo;blog&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
