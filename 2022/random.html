<p>
It has been a while since I wrote something here, and I think the reason for that is…
writing is not really central to my day-to-day &ldquo;flow&rdquo;. For example, I do write <i>a lot</i> as
I do journaling. But writing a blog post or an article is longer, and usually, it is
happening in my <code>org</code> folders.
</p>

<p>
I am currently trying to re-organize a bit the website and my publishing workflow to
reduce as much as possible the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; between when and what I write and when and where it
is published. I think I&rsquo;ve been inspired by <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">Joel&rsquo;s digital garden</a> article.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For as long as I&rsquo;ve been writing words on the internet, I&rsquo;ve connected the words that I create in a paginated chronological format. This is the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; blog style website. A linear newest-first sorted chronologically oriented list of posts.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m convinced that paginated posted sorted chronologically fuckin&rsquo; sucks.
</p>

<p>
What makes a garden is interesting. It&rsquo;s personal. Things are organized and orderly, but with a touch of chaos around the edges.
</p>

<p>
Just like plants in the garden I&rsquo;ve got posts that are in various stages of growth and nurturing. Some might wither and die, and others (like this one you are reading) will flourish and provide a source of continued for the gardener and folks in community that visit 👋
</p>

<p>
Chronologically sorted pages of posts aren&rsquo;t how people actually use the internet.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I am also going to re-design a little bit (as little as possible really) to be even more
aligned with my current &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo;. And there, I am taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.la-grange.net/">La Grange</a> from
<a href="https://www.la-grange.net/karl/">Karl Dubost</a>. Karl keeps the &ldquo;design&rdquo; (or style or whatever) of its page as they are / were
when he is published the content. This means, a page written 10 years ago, will be
rendered the same (<i>with devil in details if the browser changed something or course</i>), 10
years ago or now. And, <i>for some reason</i>, this is <b>really</b> appealing to me. I am slowing
and incrementally trying to achieve that. Also, <i>note</i> that the redesign is very subtle
as, the more I am looking at the current theme, the more most of it seems good enough for me.
</p>

<p>
I am also making sure I keep an <a href="../sandbox.html">sandbox</a> page always <mark>up-to-date</mark>.
